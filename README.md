This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About the project

This is a clone of the site - https://nextquest.nl/en/services-and-courses/boat-tour-international-bar/

## About the project

Tools used: 
1. Nextjs
2. Tailwind css and components - I chose tailwind css and used the existing components readily available from their site
3. I have used the font - Lexend deca from google fonts. ( This is the exact same font used on the nextquest webpage)
4. Although i could divide the entire webpage into different components - i only chose to differentiate the form and footer component from the others.
5. I did want to use internationalization in order to allow the users to select two languages (as available on the original site - due to time constraints i decided not to go with this for now)
6. I have also ensured the entire site is mobile friendly and responsive for devices with different resolutions.
7. I chose netlify as a platform of choice to deploy the application.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
